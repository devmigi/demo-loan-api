## Loan API Project
**Laravel Code Challenge**
> Your task is to build a mini-aspire API:\
It is an app that allows authenticated users to go through a loan application. It doesn’t have to contain too many fields, but at least “amount
required” and “loan term.” All the loans will be assumed to have a “weekly” repayment frequency.
After the loan is approved, the user must be able to submit the weekly loan repayments. It can be a simplified repay functionality, which won’t
need to check if the dates are correct but will just set the weekly amount to be repaid.

\
\
**Notes**:
- Build fully functional REST API without any UI
- README.md should contain all the information that the reviewers need to run and use the app
- Write code with your teammates in mind: readable, easy to review & understand
- The quality of the tests is one of the key factors
- Include brief documentation for the project: the choices you made and why


**Nice-to-have**:
- script to install the app in one go
- postman collection/openAPI document for the API
- The complete project should be shared with us as a public GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab repo
